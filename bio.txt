 <h3>About Me </h3>
<img src="images/photo_jo.jpg" align="left" width="150"><p>I am currently a NASA Hubble fellow working at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton. Prior to moving to Princeton, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics.  I completed my PhD at the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge, investigating protoplanetary disc evolution and dispersal under the supervision of Professor Cathie Clarke. I undertook my undergraduate studies at the Univeristy of Cambridge, Churchill College.</p>
							<p>My research interests are within the fields of
    star and planet formation, with emphasis on the radiative and
    hydrodynamic pheomena involved. I am currently involved in several
    projects with various groups exploring the various effects high
    energy radiation will have on the circumstellar enviornment.</p>
